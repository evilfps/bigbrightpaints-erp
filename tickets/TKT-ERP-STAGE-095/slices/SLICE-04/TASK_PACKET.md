# Task Packet

Ticket: `TKT-ERP-STAGE-095`
Slice: `SLICE-04`
Primary Agent: `refactor-techdebt-gc`
Reviewers: `qa-reliability`
Lane: `w4`
Branch: `tickets/tkt-erp-stage-095/refactor-techdebt-gc`
Worktree: `/Users/anas/Documents/orchestrator_erp/bigbrightpaints-erp_worktrees/TKT-ERP-STAGE-095/refactor-techdebt-gc`

## Objective
M18-S4 approval governance: enforce approval/override matrix with maker-checker, reason codes, and immutable audit metadata across sales, purchasing, and accounting exception flows

## Custom Multi-Agent Role (Codex)
- role: `cross_module_high`
- config_file: `.codex/agents/cross_module_high.toml`
- runtime_profile: `resolved at runtime from role config`

## Agent Write Boundary (Enforced)
- `erp-domain/src/main/java/`
- `erp-domain/src/test/java/`
- `docs/`

## Requested Focus Paths
- `erp-domain/src/test/java/com/bigbrightpaints/erp/modules/purchasing/`
- `erp-domain/src/test/java/com/bigbrightpaints/erp/truthsuite/accounting/`
- `erp-domain/src/test/java/com/bigbrightpaints/erp/truthsuite/o2c/`
- `erp-domain/src/test/java/com/bigbrightpaints/erp/truthsuite/p2p/`

## Required Checks Before Done
- `bash ci/check-architecture.sh`
- `cd erp-domain && mvn -B -ntp test`

## Reviewer Contract
- Review-only agents do not commit code.
- Add one review file per reviewer under `tickets/<id>/slices/<slice>/reviews/`.
- Mark review status as `approved` only with concrete evidence.

## Agent Identity Contract
- First output line must be: `I am refactor-techdebt-gc and I own SLICE-04.`

## Shipability Bar
- The patch must be minimal, deterministic, and test-backed.
- Do not change behavior outside explicit scope without evidence and rationale.
- If any safety invariant is uncertain, fail closed and document blocker with evidence.

## Agent Prompt (Copy/Paste)
```text
You are `refactor-techdebt-gc`.
Start your first line with: `I am refactor-techdebt-gc and I own SLICE-04.`
Use Codex custom multi-agent role `cross_module_high` from `.codex/agents/cross_module_high.toml`.
Implement this slice with minimal safe patching and proof-backed output.

Required output:
- identity
- files_changed
- commands_run
- harness_results
- residual_risks
- blockers_or_next_step
```
