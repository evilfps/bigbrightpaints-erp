# Sales / Order-to-Cash Module Packet

Last reviewed: 2026-04-08

This packet documents the sales module, which owns **commercial lifecycle truth** for the ERP. It covers dealer/customer management, order lifecycle, credit controls, dispatch coordination, dealer self-service, and the canonical order-to-cash path through dispatch and settlement boundaries.

Stock and dispatch execution truth is documented separately in [inventory.md](inventory.md). Factory/manufacturing execution truth (production logs, packing, packaging mappings) is documented in [factory.md](factory.md). The sales module coordinates the commercial side of dispatch; inventory executes the stock side effects.

| Route | Method | Roles | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/v1/dispatch/confirm` | POST | OPERATIONAL_DISPATCH | Confirm dispatch (delegates to sales reconciliation) |

---

## Key Services and Engines

### `SalesCoreEngine`

The central engine for order and dealer management. Handles:

- **Dealer CRUD**: create, update, soft-delete (status = INACTIVE), receivable account provisioning
- **Order lifecycle**: create, update, confirm, cancel, status transitions
- **Credit enforcement**: credit-limit checks on order creation and confirmation for credit-mode orders
- **Dispatch confirmation**: the authoritative `confirmDispatch()` method runs under `SERIALIZABLE` isolation, performing inventory dispatch, AR/revenue journal posting, COGS journal posting, invoice issuance, and dealer balance updates
- **Idempotency**: multi-strategy idempotency key resolution (canonical `Idempotency-Key` header, legacy `X-Idempotency-Key` header, body field, legacy default-payment-mode and split-payment signatures)
- **Proforma boundary**: `SalesProformaBoundaryService` determines whether an order has sufficient finished goods or should be placed in `PENDING_PRODUCTION`
- **GST handling**: order-level GST treatment, rate resolution, inclusive/exclusive calculation

### `SalesOrderLifecycleService`

Thin facade over `SalesCoreEngine` for lifecycle operations: confirm, cancel, status update, timeline, dispatch check, trace ID attachment, and orchestrator workflow status.

### `SalesFulfillmentService`

Orchestrates the full fulfillment chain in one atomic transaction:

1. Reserve inventory (`FinishedGoodsService.reserveForOrder()`)
2. Confirm dispatch via `SalesService.confirmDispatch()` (which runs inventory dispatch + COGS posting + AR/revenue journal + invoice issuance)
3. Returns fulfillment result with all posted entries

**Important**: Invoice always owns AR/Revenue/Tax posting. If `issueInvoice=true`, `postSalesJournal` is automatically disabled to prevent double posting.

### `SalesReturnService`

Handles sales returns: goods return to inventory, reversal journal entries, and credit note generation. Crosses into inventory (batch return) and accounting (reversal postings).

### `DealerService`

Dealer management service handling:

- Dealer CRUD with auto-provisioning of portal user accounts (`ScopedAccountBootstrapService`)
- Dealer-directory reads with optional `status`, `page`, and `size`; omitting
  pagination returns the full active-only directory, while `status=ALL` lifts
  the default status filter
- Stable dealer-directory windowing order when `page`/`size` is supplied:
  `name ASC, id ASC`
- Auto-generation of dealer codes and receivable accounts
- Credit utilization calculation (outstanding + pending order exposure vs credit limit)
- Credit status classification: `WITHIN_LIMIT`, `NEAR_LIMIT` (≥80%), `OVER_LIMIT`
- Aging summary and ledger views for dealer detail pages

### `DealerPortalService`

Dealer self-service operations. Resolves the authenticated dealer from the security context, then scopes all data (dashboard, ledger, invoices, aging, orders) to that dealer. Also provides requester identity for credit-limit requests.

### `CreditLimitRequestService`

Durable credit-limit increase requests:

- Created by sales/admin internally or by dealers via the portal
- Each request records `dealerId`, `amountRequested`, `reason`, `requesterUserId`, `requesterEmail`
- Approval increments the dealer's credit limit by `amountRequested`
- Rejection leaves the limit unchanged
- Both approval and rejection require a decision reason
- Approval and rejection require ADMIN or ACCOUNTING role
- `requesterUserId` is nullable for historical rows

### `CreditLimitOverrideService`

Temporary credit headroom override requests:

- Created when a dealer needs temporary headroom beyond base credit limit
- Canonical request payload uses `requestedAmount` (legacy `dispatchAmount` remains as an alias)
- May optionally bind to a specific packaging slip and/or sales order context
- Calculates required headroom from **outstanding + pending-order exposure + requested amount** vs base credit limit
- Approval raises effective credit headroom consumed by canonical order credit checks
- Has expiry behavior (`EXPIRED` status for stale requests)

### `DunningService`

Overdue payment management:

- `placeDealerOnHold()`: explicit manual hold action for `POST /api/v1/dealers/{dealerId}/dunning/hold` (no threshold query/body inputs)
- `evaluateDealerHold()`: evaluates a single dealer's aging against thresholds and places on `ON_HOLD` if overdue (internal/service-level behavior)
- Scheduled daily automation: evaluates all dealers for the 45+ day aging bucket
- Sends overdue reminder emails when hold is placed

### `SalesService`

High-level facade that delegates to `SalesCoreEngine` for order operations and `SalesDispatchReconciliationService` for dispatch.

### `SalesDashboardService`

Provides sales dashboard contract fields via `SalesDashboardDto`:

- `recentOrdersCount` (last 30-day order count)
- `totalRevenue`
- `totalReceivables`
- `pendingOrders`

## Order Status Lifecycle

### Canonical Workflow Statuses

These statuses progress through the order lifecycle automatically:

| Status | Meaning | Transition Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DRAFT` | Order created, not yet confirmed | Initial status on creation |
| `RESERVED` | Stock available, not yet confirmed | Auto-assessed on creation/update if no shortages |
| `PENDING_PRODUCTION` | Stock shortage, needs production | Auto-assessed on creation/update if shortages found |
| `PENDING_INVENTORY` | Inventory pending | Orchestrator workflow status |
| `PROCESSING` | Being processed | Orchestrator workflow status |
| `READY_TO_SHIP` | Ready for shipment | Orchestrator workflow status |
| `CONFIRMED` | Order confirmed by sales | `POST /sales/orders/{id}/confirm` |
| `DISPATCHED` | Goods dispatched | Set by dispatch confirmation |
| `INVOICED` | Invoice issued | Set during dispatch confirmation |
| `SETTLED` | Payment settled | External settlement process |
| `CANCELLED` | Order cancelled | `POST /sales/orders/{id}/cancel` (requires reason code) |

### Manual Statuses

These can only be set via `PATCH /sales/orders/{id}/status`:

| Status | Meaning | Constraint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ON_HOLD` | Manually held | Can be set on any non-terminal order |
| `REJECTED` | Order rejected | Terminal status |
| `CLOSED` | Order closed | Only after `SETTLED` |

### Terminal Statuses

Once reached, no further workflow transitions: `CANCELLED`, `REJECTED`, `CLOSED`.

### Non-Canonical / Legacy Statuses

The `VALID_ORDER_STATUSES` set also includes: `BOOKED`, `SHIPPED`, `FULFILLED`, `COMPLETED`. These are accepted by the status normalization logic for backward compatibility but are **not** part of the canonical lifecycle. `BOOKED` is treated as an alias for pre-confirmation state in some flows. `SHIPPED`, `FULFILLED`, and `COMPLETED` are dashboard classification statuses that map into the `dispatched` or `completed` buckets.

---

## Credit Controls

### Credit Limit Enforcement

Credit checks fire in two places:

1. **Order creation** (`SalesCoreEngine.createOrder()`): For credit-mode orders, enforces credit limit before saving the order. If the check fails, the engine attempts idempotent replay before throwing.
2. **Order confirmation** (`SalesCoreEngine.confirmOrder()`): Re-checks credit limit before allowing confirmation.

The credit check evaluates:

- **Outstanding balance**: current dealer ledger balance from `DealerLedgerService`
- **Pending order exposure**: sum of total amounts for non-terminal orders on the same dealer
- **Credit used** = outstanding balance + pending order exposure
- **Available credit** = credit limit − credit used (floored at zero)

If credit used exceeds the limit, a `CreditLimitExceededException` is thrown.

### Credit Status Classification

| Status | Threshold |
| --- | --- |
| `WITHIN_LIMIT` | credit used < 80% of credit limit |
| `NEAR_LIMIT` | credit used ≥ 80% but < 100% |
| `OVER_LIMIT` | credit used ≥ 100% |

### Credit Limit Requests (Durable Increase)

These are permanent credit-limit increases:

- **Created by**: sales/admin via `/api/v1/credit/limit-requests` or dealers via `/api/v1/dealer-portal/credit-limit-requests`
- **Approved by**: admin or accounting via `/api/v1/credit/limit-requests/{id}/approve`
- **Effect on approval**: dealer credit limit incremented by `amountRequested`
- **Audit**: approval and rejection decisions are audited with old/new limits

### Credit Limit Overrides (Temporary Dealer Headroom)

These are temporary dealer-level headroom exceptions used by canonical order credit checks:

- **Created by**: admin/factory/sales via `/api/v1/credit/override-requests`
- **Approved by**: admin or accounting (`/approve`)
- **Canonical payload**: `dealerId` + `requestedAmount` + `reason` (legacy `dispatchAmount` remains an alias)
- **Optional context**: `salesOrderId` / `packagingSlipId` for correlation only
- **Lifecycle**: PENDING → APPROVED / REJECTED / EXPIRED
- **Headroom formula**: `requiredHeadroom = max(0, outstandingBalance + pendingOrderExposure + requestedAmount - creditLimit)`
- **Effect**: approval raises effective dealer headroom consumed by order-create/order-confirm credit posture checks; over-limit orders return `422` only when approved headroom is insufficient

### Dunning

- Manual action: `POST /api/v1/dealers/{dealerId}/dunning/hold` explicitly places the dealer in `ON_HOLD` and returns `dealerId`, `dunningHeld`, `status`, and `alreadyOnHold`
- Automated daily: `DunningService` scheduled task evaluates all dealers against the 45+ day aging bucket
- Effect: sets dealer status to `ON_HOLD` and sends overdue reminder email

---

## Dispatch and O2C Completion Boundary

### Dispatch Ownership (Two-Layer Seam)

Dispatch is explicitly a two-layer seam:

| Layer | Owner | Surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Transport/controller location** | `DispatchController` (inventory module) | `POST /api/v1/dispatch/confirm` |
| **Commercial/accounting ownership** | `SalesCoreEngine.confirmDispatch()` via `SalesDispatchReconciliationService` | Same endpoint, delegated call |

The inventory controller receives the HTTP request, validates factory dispatch metadata (transporter, vehicle, challan for factory-role users), and delegates to `SalesDispatchReconciliationService.confirmDispatch()` which calls `SalesCoreEngine.confirmDispatch()`.

### What Dispatch Confirmation Does

`SalesCoreEngine.confirmDispatch()` runs under `SERIALIZABLE` isolation and performs:

1. **Validates** the packaging slip and sales order exist and are in a valid state
2. **Checks credit limit** (unless `adminOverrideCreditLimit` is set with a valid override request)
3. **Dispatches inventory** via `FinishedGoodsService.confirmDispatch()` — FIFO/LIFO/WAC cost layer resolution, stock reduction, batch tracking
4. **Posts COGS journal** — debit COGS account, credit inventory account, per slip line
5. **Posts AR/Revenue journal** — debit AR (dealer receivable), credit revenue, credit GST payable
6. **Issues invoice** — auto-creates invoice linked to the slip and order
7. **Updates dealer balance** via `DealerLedgerService`
8. **Sets order markers** — `salesJournalEntryId`, `fulfillmentInvoiceId`, dispatch flags on the order
9. **Transitions order status** to `DISPATCHED` or `INVOICED`

### Current O2C Completion Boundary

The canonical O2C path today:

```
Order Created (DRAFT/RESERVED/PENDING_PRODUCTION)
  → Order Confirmed (CONFIRMED)
  → Dispatch Confirmed (DISPATCHED + INVOICED)
  → [Settlement] (SETTLED)
  → [Manual Close] (CLOSED)
```

**Definition of done for O2C today**: An order is considered commercially complete when it has been dispatched, invoiced, and the invoice has been paid/settled. The settlement step is tracked via external accounting processes (not an automated sales module operation). An order can be manually closed after settlement.

### What Is Not Yet Automated

- **Settlement**: Payment receipt and allocation against invoices is handled through accounting settlement workflows, not directly through the sales module
- **Automated close**: Orders must be manually moved to `CLOSED` after settlement via `PATCH /sales/orders/{id}/status`
- **Shipment tracking**: No automated carrier/tracking integration; transport metadata is captured at dispatch but not tracked

---

## Dealer Self-Service Portal

### Host Ownership

| Host | Owner | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/v1/dealer-portal/**` | `DealerPortalController` | Dealer self-service, `ROLE_DEALER` only |
| `/api/v1/dealer-portal/support/tickets/**` | `DealerPortalSupportTicketController` | Dealer support tickets, `ROLE_DEALER` only |

All dealer-portal endpoints require `ROLE_DEALER` and automatically scope data to the authenticated dealer's identity. Cross-dealer data access is prevented at the service layer.

### Self-Service Capabilities

Dealers can:

- View their dashboard (balance, credit, aging)
- View their full ledger with running balance
- View and download their invoices (PDF)
- View their outstanding balance with aging buckets
- View their orders
- Submit credit-limit increase requests
- Create and view support tickets

### Isolation Boundaries

- Data scoping: `DealerPortalService.getCurrentDealer()` resolves the dealer from the authenticated user's identity, then all queries filter by that dealer
- Invoice PDF access: dealer can only download their own invoices; cross-dealer access returns 404
- Credit requests: dealer-scoped, auto-populated with the current dealer's ID

---

## Events

| Event | Trigger | Consumer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SalesOrderCreatedEvent` | Order creation | Published via Spring `ApplicationEventPublisher`; used for cross-module coordination (e.g., orchestrator, metrics) |

The sales module currently publishes only one domain event. Other coordination happens through direct service calls rather than event-driven patterns.

---

## Cross-Module Boundaries

| Boundary | Direction | Nature |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sales → Inventory** | Outbound | Order creation triggers stock reservation; dispatch confirmation triggers stock dispatch and COGS posting |
| **Sales → Accounting** | Outbound | Dispatch confirmation posts AR/revenue and COGS journals; sales returns post reversal journals |
| **Sales → Invoice** | Outbound | Dispatch confirmation auto-issues invoices |
| **Sales → Auth** | Outbound | Dealer provisioning creates portal user accounts with `ROLE_DEALER` |
| **Inventory → Sales** | Inbound | `DispatchController` delegates to `SalesDispatchReconciliationService` for commercial side effects |
| **Accounting → Sales** | Read | `DealerLedgerService`, `StatementService` provide dealer balance/aging data to sales services |

---

## Deprecated and Non-Canonical Surfaces

### Dealer Alias Routes

`GET /api/v1/sales/dealers` and `GET /api/v1/sales/dealers/search` are
**frontend convenience aliases** that delegate to `DealerService`. The canonical
dealer routes are at `/api/v1/dealers`. The alias routes exist because the
frontend currently calls the `/sales/dealers` path. Both sets of routes produce
identical results, including the dealer-directory compatibility rules:

- omit `page` and `size` to return the full active-only directory
- pass `status=ALL` to include non-active dealers
- if `page` and/or `size` is supplied, the backend returns a sliced
  `DealerResponse[]` list without total-count metadata

### Legacy Payment Mode Idempotency

The `SalesCoreEngine` resolves idempotency across three signature strategies:

1. **Canonical**: current request signature with explicit payment mode
2. **Legacy default-payment**: signature computed with default payment mode (`CREDIT`) for orders created before payment mode was tracked
3. **Legacy split-replay**: signature for orders that previously used `SPLIT` payment mode

This backward compatibility exists to prevent duplicate orders when replaying requests from older frontend versions. The `X-Idempotency-Key` header is a legacy alias for `Idempotency-Key`; both are accepted but `Idempotency-Key` is canonical.

### Legacy/Compatibility Order Statuses

The statuses `BOOKED`, `SHIPPED`, `FULFILLED`, and `COMPLETED` are accepted by status normalization but are not part of the canonical lifecycle. They exist for backward compatibility with older data. Dashboard bucketing maps them into canonical categories:

- `BOOKED` → `in_progress`
- `SHIPPED`, `FULFILLED` → `dispatched`
- `COMPLETED` → `completed`

The same normalization is used by `GET /api/v1/sales/orders/search`, so
canonical search filters continue to find older rows stored under legacy status
names.

### Credit Request Nullable Requester Fields

`CreditRequest.requesterUserId` is nullable for historical rows created before requester tracking was added. New requests always populate both `requesterUserId` and `requesterEmail`.

---

## Current Limitations

> **Note**: The authoritative classification for these items is recorded in the [Authoritative Recommendations Register](../RECOMMENDATIONS.md). This section documents factual implementation status only.

1. **No automated settlement**: Payment receipt and allocation against invoices happens through accounting workflows, not the sales module. Orders move to `SETTLED` externally.
2. **No automated order closure**: After settlement, orders must be manually closed via the status endpoint.
3. **Single domain event**: Only `SalesOrderCreatedEvent` is published. Order confirmation, dispatch, and cancellation do not emit domain events, limiting event-driven extension.
4. **No shipment tracking integration**: Transport metadata is captured at dispatch but not integrated with carrier systems.
5. **Dunning is rudimentary**: The scheduled task evaluates 45+ day aging only; there is no graduated dunning escalation.
6. **Proforma boundary is assessment-only**: `SalesProformaBoundaryService` assesses commercial availability but does not reserve stock or post accounting entries during order creation. Orders with shortages are placed in `PENDING_PRODUCTION` without triggering production automatically.
7. **Factory task cancellation**: Order cancellation cancels linked factory tasks, but there is no bidirectional status sync between factory tasks and sales orders beyond the initial cancellation.
8. **No partial fulfillment**: `SalesFulfillmentService` does not support partial fulfillment by default; orders with stock shortages fail unless `allowPartialFulfillment` is explicitly enabled.
