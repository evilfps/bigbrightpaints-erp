# Frontend Handoff

API contracts, flow documentation, and design guidance for frontend developers.

**What belongs here:** Endpoint maps per module, request/response schemas, user flow descriptions, state machines, error codes, and UI hints.
**Updated by:** Backend workers after implementing/refactoring each module.

---

## Documentation Format Per Module

Each module section should include:
1. **Endpoint Map** - All REST endpoints with HTTP method, path, auth requirements, request/response types
2. **User Flows** - Step-by-step flows a frontend would implement (e.g., "Create Sales Order" flow with all API calls in sequence)
3. **State Machines** - Entity lifecycle states and valid transitions (e.g., Order: Draft -> Confirmed -> Dispatched -> Invoiced)
4. **Error Codes** - Module-specific error codes the frontend should handle with suggested UX behavior
5. **Data Contracts** - Key request/response DTOs with field descriptions and validation rules
6. **UI Hints** - Suggested form fields, required vs optional, dropdowns vs free text, dependent fields
